# ASK
ASK-Attack and ASK-Defense

## ASK - Adversarial Soft k-Nearest Neighbor Attack and Defense

### Platform
* Python: 3.7
* PyTorch: 1.5.0

### Intro
ASK provides a novel Adversarial Soft kNN Attack, which has superior attack efficiency and accuracy degradation relative to previous kNN-based attacks. 
ASK also provides an Adversarial Soft kNN Defense that can improve the robustness of both kNN-based classifiers and DNNs.
